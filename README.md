### 
* Created [MaqamWorld](http://maqamworld.com), the leading internet resource for Arabic music theory, with over 500 daily active users, translated into 8 languages. For a sample of the writing and organization I recommend looking at [The Arabic Maqam](https://maqamworld.com/en/maqam.php) Page.

* Co-Authored [Inside Arabic Music](https://www.amazon.com/Inside-Arabic-Music-Performance-Century/dp/0190658363), Oxford University Press (2019), a referece book on Arabic music theory and performance, with over 4000 copies sold. Some of the reader feedback from Amazon:

> “In terms of structure, _Inside Arabic Music_ is a marvel in readability. With each chapter limited to about 20 pages, the authors masterfully discuss a massive amount of information in a lucid language.”

> “The book follows a scientific method and is very organized.”

> “It’s very structured, very informative, and very clear!“

> “It is complex and academic on one hand, while readable and informative on the other.”

> “The book is full of relevant info. It can be heavy at times as it does lean in a very academic direction, but it is very thoughtfully arranged and concise in concept.”

> “The book follows a scientific method and very organized, at the same time it presents the content in a smooth manner, away from the dry academic presentation, with many examples that makes it easier for the reader. The book presents content using many metaphors.“

* A sample [Migration Guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pbAR2nj7Di6YjB-8aJv4HZNMzRTq6qq83U2F8wvN8wg/edit?usp=sharing) from a (hypothetical) proprietary SecureVault Password Manager to the Amazon Web Services Secrets Manager.

* A sample [API Reference Guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RM4tDuAbpbB9qwTceVQ9_0Yru0MBCt2IvA1bbftN0ug/edit?usp=sharing) for the hypothetical `Customer Secrets Manager` REST API. 

* A sample [CLI Reference Guide](xxx) for a hypothetical `secretsmgr` command line tool.
