Sample reader feedback from Amazon:

> “In terms of structure, _Inside Arabic Music_ is a marvel in readability. With each chapter limited to about 20 pages, the authors masterfully discuss a massive amount of information in a lucid language.”

> “The book follows a scientific method and is very organized.”

> “It’s very structured, very informative, and very clear!“

> “It is complex and academic on one hand, while readable and informative on the other.”

> “The book is full of relevant info. It can be heavy at times as it does lean in a very academic direction, but it is very thoughtfully arranged and concise in concept.”

> “The book follows a scientific method and very organized, at the same time it presents the content in a smooth manner, away from the dry academic presentation, with many examples that makes it easier for the reader. The book presents content using many metaphors.“

* Created [MaqamWorld](http://maqamworld.com), the leading internet resource for Arabic music theory, with over 500 daily active users, translated into 8 languages. For a sample of the writing and organization I recommend looking at [The Arabic Maqam](https://maqamworld.com/en/maqam.php) Page.
